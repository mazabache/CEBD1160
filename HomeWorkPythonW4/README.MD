Data Interpretation
While generating the different graphs, some graphs allowed me to quickly arrive a conclusion about the interpreation of the data.

For example Figure_7.png, which is a box plot combined with a swarm plot, showed right away that:
-Blood Pressure distribution was different for Females and Males.
-Showed the median and all quartiles groups for each sex
-Showed the outliers (which could be potentially be removed from the sample for further analysis)

Figure_28.png, which is a violing plot, also represented the same data. However, somehow it was not as explicit as Figure_7.png. The Violin plot, did not show the outliers. Also the quartile representation was not as explicit.
